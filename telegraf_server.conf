  ## On systems which support it, device metadata can be added in the form of

  ## Currently only Linux is supported via udev properties. You can view
  ## available properties for a device by running:
  ## 'udevadm info -q property -n /dev/sda'

  ## that are currently inaccessible include DEVTYPE, DEVNAME, and DEVPATH.

  ## Using the same metadata source as device_tags, you can also customize the
  ## name of the device via templates.

  ## the device. The template may contain variables in the form of '$PROPERTY' or
  ## '${PROPERTY}'. The first template which does not contain any variables not

  ## The typical use case is for LVM volumes, to get the VG/LV name instead of
